    "Answer:\n",
    "    In object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance is a fundamental concept that allows a class to inherit properties\n",
    "    and behaviors from another class.\n",
    "    \"It establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes, where a new class, known as a derived class \n",
    "    or subclass,can inherit attributes and methods from an existing class, called the base class or superclass.\n",

    "2. Discuss the concept of single inheritance and multiple inheritance, highlighting their\n",
    "differences and advantages.\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "    ->Single inheritance is a form of inheritance where a derived class inherits from a single base class.\n",
    "    This means that a class can have only one direct superclass.\n",
    "    Merits: Single inheritance provides a straightforward and linear class hierarchy.\n",
    "    It is easy to understand and maintain as there is only one direct base class.\n",
    "    ->Multiple Inheritance is a feature that allows a derived class to inherit from multiple base classes.\n",
    "    In this approach, a class can have multiple direct superclasses, and it inherits the attributes and \n",
    "    behaviors from all of them.\n",
    "    Multiple inheritance offers flexibility and the ability to combine features from different classes\n",
    "    Demerits:\n",
    "         1.Number of Base Classes: Single inheritance involves inheriting from a single base class\n",
    "           while multiple inheritance allows inheriting from multiple base classes.\n",
    "         2.Complexity: Multiple inheritance is generally more complex than single inheritance due to the potential \n",
    "           for conflicts and the need to manage and resolve them."
